Implement the current slice against approved acceptance.

## Steps

1. Apply **Coding Discipline** (`agentic-coding`): Implements the smallest coherent change against approved acceptance, RED to GREEN, then re-runs the exact verifier.

## Stop conditions

1. Human-approved intent and protected contracts outrank convenience.
2. Understand the relevant source, tests, contracts, and commands before changing code.
3. Preserve approved behavior and make the smallest coherent change.
4. Reuse an existing adequate verifier before generating one.
5. If a measurable claim lacks a verifier, engineer the smallest deterministic verifier and prove its sensitivity.
6. Evidence comes from execution; `UNKNOWN` and `BLOCKED` are never `PASS`.
7. Never weaken gates, thresholds, fixtures, or verifier semantics to obtain green.
8. Every replacement, temporary artifact, fallback, test, and verifier needs an explicit lifecycle disposition.
9. Cleanup is followed by re-verification.

Report `UNKNOWN` or `BLOCKED` rather than presenting an unproven claim as `PASS`.
